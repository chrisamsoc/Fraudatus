This Java-based voting program analyzes Microsoft Forms response data to determine the winner of Westmount Secondary Schoolâ€™s Talent Show using the Alternative Vote (essentially a form of ranked voting) system.
 Voters rank contestants by preference, and the program processes the data to ensure a fair, majority-based outcome. 
 . It was designed for transparency and fairness, this tool ensures every vote counts in the talent show voting process.
 The program uses two files in order to make a determination of the winner, a voting.csv file which contains each individual ballot and ranked choices, as well as a can.txt file which contains the location of the voting.csv file and the names of candidates.
